\f0\fs24 \cf0 Contrasting GUI and Command-Lines\
\
I have learned that GUI stands for Graphical user interface.  This is the interface that I am used to.  I appreciate the visual characteristics and for me that is easier to follow.  Command-line interface is something that reminds me of the beginning of computers.  The way we used DOS in the beginning.  When I use this type of interface I am much more nervous.  I have a fear that I will make a terrible irreversible mistake. I am sure that stems from my lack of understanding of how it works and knowing the commands that make it effective to work with.  }
