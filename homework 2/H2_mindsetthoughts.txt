Learning a little bit more about fixed mindset and growth mindset helped me understand how important it is to have a growth mindset.  My result from the quiz was a 53 which was having a good growth mindset.  I have always had the idea that people can change.  We all have great potential.  Whether that is in skills, or knowledge or talent.  It is the people that have a growth mindset that achieve incredible things through their effort and persistence.  

I am a 50-year-old mother of five.  Without a growth mindset I could not attempt going back to school.  I have to think that with persistence I can learn new things.  It has been said that it is harder to learn as you get older.  My outlook moving forward is that kind of thinking comes from a fixed mindset and IÕm not going to have that attitude.
